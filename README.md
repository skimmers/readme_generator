# README Generator

## Installation/Deployment

Go to this link: <https://github.com/skimmers/readme_generator> and examine the files. Download the index.js file and open it in visiual studio code and type "node index.js" in the integrated terminal to run the application. 

## Goal

The goal is to use JavaScript and Node.js to create an application that creates a README after answering questions.

These are the requirements I had to meet: 

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN I enter my project title
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

# Purpose

I believe the purpose of this assignment was to help me get practice in installing inquirer, installing node_modules, and downloading package.json while coding with javascript more. 

I learned how to download inquirer, creating package.json files, and using the terminal for prompts.
